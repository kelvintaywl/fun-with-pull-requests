# Fun With Pull Requests
A well-written pull request is easy and fun. It just takes some commitment (no puns intended).

## Introduction

Hello there, rockstar engineer. Grab a seat. 

> Perhaps you need to hang somewhere else? Read the [**TL;DR**](#tldr) version then.

You have spent some time writing good code. Now it is time to push your commits and submit a pull request.

That elegant solution needs a summary in the pull request. 


| *Surely, that is elementary, my dear Watson!* |
| ---- |

*Or is it?*

Remember a pull request documentation is often the first piece of text another developer sees before perusing your code.

Unlike a teacher marking your essay, reviewers of your code may not know why the pull request is even necessary.

This repository is thus to document how I try to write good pull request documentation so that my team members can digest my entire pull request better.

Unless you work alone, chances are you make pull requests. The more we practise, the better we all can get at this.

Yay to better communications and collaboration happiness for all developers.


## TL;DR

This is a repository (linked to Gitbook.io) where I try to share my ideas on how we can all write beautiful pull requests. Yay for better communications, and collaboration happiness.
